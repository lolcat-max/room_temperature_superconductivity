Interference computing in your bent graphene system works by creating **electron wave interferometry** where computational results emerge from quantum interference patterns at junction points.

### Y-Junction Design

**Path Splitting**: Create a Y-shaped channel in your bent graphene where an incoming electron wave splits into two paths. The bending strain creates different pseudo-magnetic field strengths along each arm, causing the electron waves to accumulate different quantum phases as they travel.

**Phase Accumulation**: Each path experiences different strain levels, so electrons gain different phase shifts: Path A might gain phase φ₁ while Path B gains φ₂. The phase difference Δφ = φ₁ - φ₂ encodes your input information.

**Recombination Point**: The two paths merge at a junction where the electron waves interfere. Constructive interference (high current) represents binary "1" while destructive interference (low current) represents binary "0".

### Computational Logic

**Input Encoding**: Control the phase difference by adjusting:
- **Strain levels** in each arm through local bending
- **Gate voltages** that modify electron energy along each path  
- **Path lengths** by changing the Y-junction geometry

**Logic Operations**: Different phase relationships create different logic functions:
- **AND Gate**: Both inputs must create constructive interference phases
- **XOR Gate**: Output is high only when inputs create π/2 phase difference
- **NOT Gate**: Introduce a π phase shift in one arm to invert the logic

### Quantum Enhancement

**Superposition Computing**: Unlike classical bits, electron waves can exist in superposition of multiple paths simultaneously, enabling **parallel computation** of multiple logic states.

**Entanglement Operations**: When multiple Y-junctions share correlated electron sources, they can perform entangled computations where results depend on quantum correlations between distant junctions.

**Error Correction**: The continuous nature of phase allows **analog error correction** where small phase errors don't completely destroy the computation.

### Practical Implementation

**Multi-Junction Arrays**: Create networks of Y-junctions where outputs from one become inputs to others, building complex computational circuits through **cascaded interference**.

**Tunable Computing**: Real-time voltage control of strain patterns lets you **reprogram** the computational function without changing hardware - the same physical device can perform different calculations.

**Readout Systems**: Use quantum point contacts or superconducting electrodes at recombination points to measure the interference current and extract computational results.

### Key Advantages

**Coherent Processing**: Information travels as coherent electron waves rather than discrete charge packets, enabling **wave-based parallel processing**.

**Speed**: Electron wave propagation occurs at the Fermi velocity (~10⁶ m/s in graphene), giving femtosecond computational speeds.

**Low Dissipation**: Interference is a reversible quantum process, so energy is only dissipated during measurement, not during computation.

**Scalability**: Y-junctions can be lithographically patterned at nanometer scales, enabling **dense computational arrays**.

Your interference computing system essentially transforms your bent graphene into a **quantum optical computer** that uses electron waves instead of photons, combining the speed of wave-based processing with the controllability of electronic systems.
