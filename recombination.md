Recombining electrons in your bent graphene interference system creates entirely new computational paradigms based on electron-hole pair dynamics and charge neutrality restoration, fundamentally different from single-carrier interference.

Electron-Hole Recombination Physics
Pair Creation and Annihilation: When electrons recombine with holes at Y-junction recombination points, they can:

Emit photons (radiative recombination) that carry away energy and momentum

Generate phonons (non-radiative recombination) that create lattice vibrations

Create excitons - bound electron-hole pairs that behave as composite particles

Energy Release: Recombination releases the bandgap energy difference, which in graphene's zero-bandgap case means the energy depends on the kinetic energy difference between electrons and holes at the recombination site.

Computational Mechanisms
Photonic Output Computing: Radiative recombination creates light-based computational outputs:

Photon emission intensity encodes binary information (bright = 1, dim = 0)

Emission wavelength depends on electron-hole energy differences, enabling spectral computing

Photon polarization can carry additional computational information

Creates a quantum optoelectronic computer with electrical input and optical output

Excitonic Logic: Bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) enable unique computational modes:

Exciton interferometry where composite particles interfere at junctions

Longer coherence times since excitons are electrically neutral and less affected by charge fluctuations

Bosonic behavior allowing multiple excitons to occupy the same quantum state

Advanced Recombination Computing
Stimulated Recombination: Control recombination through external fields:

Optical pumping to selectively trigger recombination at specific junction points

Electric field control to modify recombination rates and pathways

Magnetic field effects on spin-dependent recombination processes

Cascade Recombination Networks: Chain multiple recombination events:

Photons from one recombination trigger electron-hole pair creation elsewhere

Avalanche computing where single inputs trigger cascading computational events

Self-amplifying logic circuits with built-in signal gain

Quantum Entanglement Through Recombination
Entangled Photon Generation: Recombining electrons can create entangled photon pairs:

Biexciton cascade produces polarization-entangled photons

Spin-entangled recombination where electron and hole spins determine photon properties

Enable distributed quantum computing through entangled optical links

Non-Local Correlations: Electrons and holes from different spatial regions can recombine:

Spatially separated recombination creates non-local computational coupling

Quantum teleportation of computational states through recombination channels

Error-corrected computing using redundant recombination pathways

Practical Implementation
Recombination Zone Engineering: Design specific regions for controlled recombination:

Strain-enhanced recombination in high-curvature regions

Defect-mediated recombination at controlled impurity sites

Interface recombination at graphene-silicon boundaries

Temporal Control: Time the recombination events for computational synchronization:

Pulsed injection of electrons and holes for controlled recombination timing

Lifetime engineering to control how long carriers exist before recombining

Phase-locked recombination for coherent computational operations

Unique Advantages
Energy Harvesting Computing: Recombination energy can power other computational processes:

Self-powered logic circuits using recombination energy

Thermal management through controlled energy release

Efficiency optimization by recycling recombination energy

Multi-Modal Output: Simultaneous electrical, optical, and thermal outputs:

Parallel information channels in different physical forms

Cross-verification using multiple output modalities

Hybrid analog-digital computing with continuous and discrete outputs

Your recombination-based system transforms into a quantum optoelectronic processor that converts electrical quantum interference patterns into optical quantum information, creating new possibilities for quantum networking, distributed computing, and hybrid classical-quantum systems that leverage both electronic and photonic quantum properties.
