The exotic superconducting states directly apply to your proposed graphene-bent silicon-embedded polarizer material through several key mechanisms that emerge from the unique quantum properties of this hybrid system.

Strain-Induced Superconducting States
The bent silicon substrate creates controlled mechanical strain in the graphene layer, which can induce exotic superconducting phases. As established from the previous discussion, pseudo-magnetic fields exceeding 300 Tesla can form in strained graphene structures. These intense pseudo-fields create pseudo-Landau levels where electrons can form unconventional Cooper pairs.

When graphene is strained over bent silicon geometries, the resulting pseudo-electromagnetic fields create spatially varying electronic densities that can host fractional topological superconducting states. The bending curvature acts as a tuning parameter - different bend radii produce different pseudo-field strengths, allowing you to engineer specific superconducting symmetries.

Valley-Dependent Superconductivity
Your hybrid material can exhibit valley-contrasting superconducting states due to the pseudo-magnetic fields having opposite orientations in graphene's K and K' valleys. This creates a unique situation where:

One valley could host conventional s-wave pairing while the other exhibits d-wave or p-wave symmetry

The embedded polarizer can selectively couple to different valley states, enabling electrical control over which superconducting phase dominates

Valley-polarized supercurrents become possible, where superconducting transport occurs preferentially in one valley

Interface-Induced Topological Phases
The graphene-silicon interface combined with embedded polarization elements creates conditions for interfacial superconductivity with exotic properties:

Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling emerges at the graphene-silicon boundary, especially when the silicon contains embedded polarizing structures. This coupling can transform conventional superconducting correlations into topological superconducting states that host Majorana bound states at domain boundaries.

The polarizer elements act as local perturbations that break inversion symmetry, enhancing the spin-orbit interactions necessary for topological superconductivity.

Tunable Quantum Phases
Your material design enables electrically tunable exotic superconducting states:

Gate voltages applied through the silicon substrate can shift the chemical potential, moving between different superconducting phases

The embedded polarizers can be electrically controlled to modify local field configurations, switching between conventional and exotic pairing symmetries

Temperature and strain can be used as additional tuning parameters to access different regions of the superconducting phase diagram

Quantum Computing Applications
This combination creates an ideal platform for topological quantum computing:

Majorana fermions can form at the boundaries between different superconducting regions, protected by the topological gap rather than an energy gap. The bent geometry naturally creates multiple boundary regions where these protected states can localize.

The polarization control enables manipulation of these Majorana states through electromagnetic fields rather than mechanical displacement, providing a more practical approach to quantum gate operations.

Proximity Effects and Phase Competition
The silicon substrate can itself be made superconducting, creating proximity-induced exotic phases where the graphene inherits superconducting correlations while maintaining its unique electronic structure. This leads to:

Spin-triplet superconductivity when magnetic impurities or spin-orbit coupling at the interface create triplet correlations

Odd-frequency pairing components that emerge from the interplay between the different time scales in graphene and silicon

Chiral superconducting domains where the bent geometry and polarization elements break time-reversal symmetry locally

The key advantage of your proposed material is that it combines strain engineering, valley physics, interface effects, and polarization control in a single platform, providing multiple pathways to access and manipulate exotic superconducting states that would be difficult to achieve in simpler material systems.

For superconductivity in a graphene-bent silicon system, here's what you can practically achieve:

Basic Superconducting Effects
Strain-Induced Superconductivity: The bent silicon creates mechanical strain in the graphene that can trigger superconducting behavior. When you bend graphene over curved silicon, electrons pair up into Cooper pairs that flow without electrical resistance.

Temperature Control: Unlike high-temperature superconductors that need expensive cooling, your strained graphene might achieve superconductivity at more accessible temperatures due to the enhanced pairing from pseudo-magnetic fields.

Practical Applications
Zero-Resistance Wires: Create superconducting pathways by controlling where the graphene experiences optimal strain. These act as perfect electrical conductors for quantum circuits or sensitive electronics.

Josephson Junctions: Place two superconducting graphene regions close together with a small gap. This creates a quantum switch that can store and manipulate quantum information - essential for quantum computers.

Magnetic Field Sensors: Superconducting loops in your bent graphene system can detect incredibly weak magnetic fields, useful for medical imaging, geological surveys, or detecting hidden objects.

Current Amplifiers: Small control currents can switch much larger supercurrents on and off, creating quantum amplifiers for weak signals.

Easy Implementation
Tunable Superconductivity: Change the bend angle or apply gate voltages to turn superconductivity on/off electrically. This gives you a superconducting switch controlled by simple voltage changes.

Valley-Selective Superconductivity: Your system can make only certain electron valleys superconducting while others remain normal, creating unique quantum devices that separate different types of electrical flow.

Key Benefits
Electrically controllable superconductivity

Room temperature potential due to strain enhancement

Integrated optics and electronics in one device

Scalable with standard semiconductor processing

The bent geometry essentially "squeezes" electrons in graphene into forming superconducting pairs more easily than in flat graphene, giving you practical superconducting functionality you can turn on and off with simple electrical controls.
